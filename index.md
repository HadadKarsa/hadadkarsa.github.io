## Implement Data Analysis on Air Quality Dataset

To gain insights from Air Quality Dataset (Dicoding's Project), I utilized the data analysis cycleto identify employe's performance based on their age and length of work hours during their employment. In process, I employed the Python and Regression models using Jupyter Notebook environment to create a robust performance prediction model.

## Tourist Visit Prediction Website with the Application of Data Mining - Decision Tree C4.5 Algorithm
I developed a predictive web platform for my undergraduate thesis (Skripsi), focusing on managing tourist visitation data for Pati Regency. The platform features a dynamic data mining tool for predicting tourist trends. The tech stack involved PHP with the CodeIgniter 3 framework, SQL databases, Python for algorithmic processing, and Bootstrap 4 for UI development.
