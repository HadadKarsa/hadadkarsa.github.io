## Implement Data Analysis Cycle and Prediction Models on Employee Dataset

To gain insights from HR Department Dataset, I utilized the data analysis cycle and prediction model approach to identify employe's performance based on their age and length of work hours during their employment. In process, I employed the Python and Regression models using Jupyter Notebook environment to create a robust performance prediction model.

## Machine Learning Model for CoffeeBid Mobile Apps
Built a coffee bean quality detection model for an online coffee auction application called CoffeeBid. In this project, I applied
TensorFlow to develop the machine learning model. In addition, I utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Convolutional Neural Network, Jupyter Notebook, MobileNet-V2 Pretrained Model, and GitHub for teamwork environment.
