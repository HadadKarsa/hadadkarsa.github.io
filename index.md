## Implement Data Analysis Cycle and Prediction Models on Employee Dataset

To gain insights from HR Department Dataset, I utilized the data analysis cycle and prediction model approach to identify employe's performance based on their age and length of work hours during their employment. In process, I employed the Python and Regression models using Jupyter Notebook environment to create a robust performance prediction model.
